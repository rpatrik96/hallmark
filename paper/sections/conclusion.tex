\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Citation hallucination is a growing threat to scientific integrity.
We contribute two complementary resources to address it.
\textsc{Hallmark} provides the first standardized benchmark for citation verification tools: 13 hallucination types across 3 difficulty tiers, 1,182 annotated entries with 6 sub-tests each, tier-weighted metrics, calibration assessment, and principled ranking under incomplete data.
\texttt{bibtex-updater} provides a practical verification tool that venues can deploy today---integrated into CI/CD pipelines, pre-commit hooks, and batch workflows---achieving 0.96 detection rate with well-calibrated confidence scores.

Our evaluation reveals systematic blind spots shared across all tools---particularly on venue-level hallucinations where bibliographic APIs lack structured data---and wide variation in confidence calibration.
These findings provide concrete, measurable targets for both tool developers and database maintainers.

Both resources are designed to grow: \textsc{Hallmark}'s community contribution system, temporal segmentation, and atomic evaluation design ensure that new entries and tools can be incorporated without invalidating prior results.
We release the full benchmark, evaluation infrastructure, and \texttt{bibtex-updater} as open-source software to support continued progress on this critical problem.
