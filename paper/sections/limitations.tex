\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

At 2,184 entries (1,266 hallucinated, with at least 30 instances per type per public split), the dataset provides statistical power per type but remains small relative to the full diversity of possible citation hallucinations.
With 30 instances per type per split, per-type metrics have 95\% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval width $\leq 0.24$ (e.g., a type-level detection rate of 90\% has a 95\% CI of [0.74, 0.98]).
Hallucination prevalence differs across splits (55.3\% in dev, 62.0\% in test, 57.8\% in hidden) due to the constraint that each of 14 types requires $\geq 30$ instances.
We emphasize prevalence-independent metrics (Detection Rate, FPR, AUROC) as primary; prevalence-sensitive metrics (F1) should be compared within splits only.
The benchmark covers only English-language BibTeX references.
The majority of hallucinated entries are synthetically generated via perturbation, though the benchmark includes 215 LLM-generated entries (produced by prompting GPT-5.1 to generate plausible citations and verifying against CrossRef/DBLP with title similarity $\geq 85$ and author Jaccard $\geq 0.5$) and 72 real-world entries harvested from documented incidents (primarily from GPTZero's NeurIPS 2025 analysis, GhostCite, and HalluCitation).
The real-world sample remains small and type-skewed (55\% \texttt{plausible\_fabrication}).
Future versions should expand real-world coverage as more documented incidents become available.
Baseline performance depends on bibliographic API availability and coverage; results may shift as APIs evolve.
We did not evaluate commercial plagiarism detection tools (Turnitin, iThenticate), which focus on textual similarity rather than citation metadata verification.
Valid entries are drawn from 2018--2025 ML venues and may not generalize to other fields or time periods.
The community contribution system is designed to address these coverage limitations over time.
All synthetic entries are generated with a single fixed seed; we did not conduct seed-sensitivity analysis, though the deterministic generation ensures exact reproducibility.

\paragraph{DOI-presence distributional artifact.}
Approximately 38\% of valid entries in the dev split lack DOI fields.
While DOI presence carries some signal for the \texttt{fabricated\_doi} hallucination type (which contains DOIs by definition), per-type metrics (\cref{sec:per_type}) enable practitioners to assess tool performance separately on types with and without this residual artifact.
