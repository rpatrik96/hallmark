\paragraph{Positive impact.}
\textsc{Hallmark} directly supports scientific integrity by enabling systematic evaluation and improvement of citation verification tools.
The benchmark enables venues to compare available tools and identify which verification gaps remain, informing deployment decisions for automated citation checking in submission pipelines.
As LLM-assisted writing becomes standard practice, reliable citation checking is essential infrastructure for maintaining trust in the scientific literature.

\paragraph{Dual-use considerations.}
A taxonomy of hallucination types could theoretically help adversaries craft harder-to-detect fabricated citations.
We believe this risk is outweighed by the defensive value: understanding hallucination types is prerequisite to detecting them.
The taxonomy is derived from publicly documented incidents and published audits, not from novel attack research.

\paragraph{Accessibility.}
\textsc{Hallmark} is open-source (MIT license), pip-installable, and requires no GPU or paid API access.
The DOI-only baseline runs without any external dependencies.
This ensures researchers at institutions with limited resources can both use and contribute to the benchmark, and venues of any size can evaluate citation verification tools.
