\section{Broader impact}
\label{sec:broader_impact}

\paragraph{Positive impact.}
\textsc{Hallmark} directly supports scientific integrity by enabling systematic evaluation and improvement of citation verification tools.
\texttt{bibtex-updater}, our reference implementation, demonstrates that venues can deploy automated citation checking immediately: a program committee can integrate it into their submission pipeline within minutes, flagging potentially fabricated references before they reach reviewers.
As LLM-assisted writing becomes standard practice, reliable citation checking is essential infrastructure for maintaining trust in the scientific literature.

\paragraph{Dual-use considerations.}
A taxonomy of hallucination types could theoretically help adversaries craft harder-to-detect fabricated citations.
We believe this risk is outweighed by the defensive value: understanding hallucination types is prerequisite to detecting them.
The taxonomy is derived from publicly documented incidents and published audits, not from novel attack research.

\paragraph{Accessibility.}
\textsc{Hallmark} and its reference implementation \texttt{bibtex-updater} are both open-source (MIT license), pip-installable, and require no GPU or paid API access.
The DOI-only baseline runs without any external dependencies.
This ensures researchers at institutions with limited resources can both use and contribute to the benchmark, and venues of any size can adopt automated citation verification.
